## About Me

### NOTE: this site under construction

I started my career in academia, studying Cognitive Psychology and Animal Behavior. Then I had a great idea for an animal borne wireless social network sensing platform, got a grant to develop it and founded a small company to manufacture and sell my tag technology. 

Recently I decided to level up for a career in Data Science. For the last year I've worked as a senior organizer for the Portland Data Science meetup group and completed the intensive 6 month Springboard Data Science Career course. 

Skills highlights: 

SCIENCE: Conducted all aspects of scientific research for 10 years: grant proposals, study design, field/lab work, research lab management, peer reviewed articles, conference talks. 

TECHNOLOGY: I've been coding since high school, mainly in C, C++, Matlab and Python. My software projects have included acoustic signal processing, experimental data analysis, statistics and visualization, Windows applications, experimental hardware control software and embedded devices.

DATA SCIENCE: I've worked on numerous Python based self-directed data science projects with explorations in deep learning (CNNs, RNNs, etc), NLP, ML, financial time series analysis, sentiment analysis, and interactive visualizations. Completed Springboard Data Science Career program.

SPECIALIZATIONS: Python, experimental design, machine learning, deep learning, data analysis, visualization, presentation and training.
