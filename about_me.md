# About Me

I started my career in academia, studying Cognitive Psychology, Neurobiology and Animal Behavior. Then I had a great idea for an wireless tag for social network monitoring, got a grant to develop it and founded a small company to manufacture and sell my tag technology. 

Recently I decided to level up for a career in Data Science. For the last year I've worked as a senior organizer for the Portland Data Science meetup group and completed the intensive 6 month Springboard Data Science Career course. 

Skills highlights: 

SCIENCE: All aspects of scientific research for 10 years. 

TECHNOLOGY: Coding since high school, CS minor in college, C, C++, Matlab, Python, SQL. Software: audio signal processing, data analysis, statistics and visualization, Windows apps, hardware control, embedded devices.

DATA SCIENCE: Numerous Python based self-directed data science projects. Deep learning (CNNs, RNNs, etc), NLP, ML, financial time series analysis, sentiment analysis, and interactive visualizations. Completed Springboard Data Science Career program.
