## 3D Printing and Lithophanes

**What's this:** A lithophane is a picture that expresses brightness of a backlight using varying thickness of material. It's a cool concept, and can be executed very well on a 3D printer too. Using online tools, I make customized photos for people and sell them. I print them with ABS plastic, because I saw many that are sold online are printed with PLA and are much more susceptible to warping from sunlight or bright lamps. 

**Can I get one?** Definitely. If you send an email to me at <custom3Dpicture@thomasjbarlow.com> with a picture of what you'd like to print then I'd be happy to get one made for you.
